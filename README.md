The War Strategy Game
The War Strategy Game is a text-based strategy game where you, as the king, must make strategic decisions to protect your kingdom during a war. You start the game with a score of 10. Your goal is to maintain or increase your score during the course of the game. If your score falls below 10, unfortunately, you have lost the war.

Game Play
The game begins with a random arrangement of your military units, and you are informed that the enemy has large catapults.

Two primary strategies are available to you:

Open the Walls: You can choose to open the walls of the kingdom and fight the enemy face to face.

Arrows: You can choose to confront the enemy over the walls through arrows.

Decisions
Once you've chosen a primary strategy, additional choices will be presented:

If you chose to Open the Walls:
Step Back: If the enemy forces seem stronger, you can choose to step back and close the walls.

Complete the War: If you feel you can overcome the enemy forces, you can choose to continue the fight.

If you chose Arrows:
Behind the Rubble: If the enemy's catapults have destroyed the walls, you can choose to continue the war from behind the rubble.

Meet the Enemy: You can choose to meet the enemy face to face.

Scoring
Each decision you make has an impact on your score. Additionally, random events occur that can increase or decrease your score. These events may be positive (e.g., finding hidden resources or receiving aid) or negative (e.g., an attack or a disease).

If your score reaches or exceeds 10 at any point during the game, you win the war. However, if your score falls below 10, you lose the war.

Repeat Play
You can choose to play the game again by entering 'yes' when prompted after each game. The game continues as long as you wish to play.
